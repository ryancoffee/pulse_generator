## time shear  
Look at the Nikita derivatives of the valence holes  
this should point to the time-separation that gives one pusle rising in carriers as the other levels off  
this seems to give the best derivative signal (the sharpest feature rising form neg to positive  


## Derivative  
The derivative looks like then the rigth AC coupled signal to use as a convolution filter.
Otherwise, we would actually rather be using the second derivative, but then that one is also 
very susceptible to the etalon, or in simulaiton, actually the spectral interference from the chirp...  
actually, it may be that we want the two birefringent pulses separated by the root(Fourier limit * time window)  No, that can't be
